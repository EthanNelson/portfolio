In 2017, there were no nonwhite men's basketball coaches in the Big Ten, the first time that had happened since the '80s. This is a [story](http://www.startribune.com/black-coaches-vanish-from-big-ten-once-a-model-for-diversity-in-college-basketball/415396354/) exploring the historical racial makeup in men's college basketball. I did the analysis and made the graphics for this story by college basketball beat reporter Marcus Fuller. This story won an [award](https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.nabj.org/resource/resmgr/awards/awards_ste_2018/2018_ste_finalists.pdf) from the National Association of Black Journalists.
